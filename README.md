#Spam Filter

In this exercise I learned how to implement a spam filter in Python, how to detect popular spam words, how to use a Naive Bayes Classifier and how to evaluate results. The spam detection algorithm: (1) loading  the data, (2) preprocessing,  (3) extracting the features, (4) training the classifier, and (5) evaluating the results.
